1. **Functional Testing**
   - Verify all commands are processed correctly
   - Check telemetry values reflect system state
   - Ensure proper task scheduling and priorities

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Measure command processing latency
   - Check stack usage under peak loads
   - Monitor memory consumption

3. **Error Handling Testing**
   - Test recovery from simulated errors
   - Check appropriate error reporting
   - Verify system stability under stress

## Conclusion

The satellite simulation system provides a solid foundation for simulating real-time embedded satellite software. The implementation demonstrates key concepts in real-time operating systems, task management, inter-process communication, and ground system interfaces. The project is ready for further expansion with additional subsystems and enhanced features.

Good luck with the continued development!
