# Satellite Simulation Project - Progress Report

## Completed Tasks

### Core Satellite Implementation
- ✅ Implemented four critical satellite tasks (MAIN_SO, TC_proc, ADCS_proc, TM_proc)
- ✅ Set up proper task priorities and stack sizes
- ✅ Implemented inter-task communication using queues
- ✅ Created mutex for protecting shared satellite data
- ✅ Added event groups for task synchronization
- ✅ Implemented resource monitoring and debugging functionalities

### Build System Setup
- ✅ Created build scripts for the satellite simulation
- ✅ Set up Docker-based build environment (Dockerfile)
- ✅ Provided multiple build options (Docker, direct, manual)

### Documentation
- ✅ Created detailed build and run guide
- ✅ Documented the system architecture and design
- ✅ Outlined ground station communication plan

### Ground Station Interface
- ✅ Designed communication protocol
- ✅ Created Python-based ground station client
- ✅ Implemented telemetry visualization

## Next Steps

### 1. Build and Test on QEMU
- Fix any remaining build issues with the QEMU target
- Test the satellite simulation in the QEMU environment
- Debug any runtime issues

### 2. Socket-Based Communication
- Implement the socket server in the satellite code
- Establish communication between QEMU and the ground station client
- Test command transmission and telemetry reception

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Implement watchdog timers
- Add more comprehensive fault detection
- Create recovery procedures for critical failures

### 4. Performance Testing
- Measure latency in command processing
- Analyze memory usage and stack consumption
- Optimize critical paths

### 5. Documentation and Training
- Complete system documentation
- Create user manual for the ground station interface
- Prepare training materials for system operators

## Technical Issues to Resolve

1. **Build System Configuration**:
   - Currently facing issues with the build system configuration
   - Need to ensure proper compilation of the satellite code
   - Resolve dependencies and include paths

2. **QEMU Integration**:
   - Ensure QEMU is correctly emulating the Cortex-M3 environment
   - Set up socket forwarding for ground station communication

3. **Resource Optimization**:
   - Analyze and optimize memory usage
   - Tune task priorities and scheduling

## Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Finalize and debug the core satellite system
2. **Week 2**: Implement socket communication and test with ground station
3. **Week 3**: Add enhanced error handling and recovery
4. **Week 4**: Performance testing and optimization
5. **Week 5**: Documentation and final delivery
